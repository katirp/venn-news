# Problem

News sites are biased. News sites have too much information on them. 

Attempts to solve bias:

- Particle
- GroundNews

Attemps to solve complexity:

- Drudge Report

Problem with apps that try to solve bias: they are BORING!! They are lists of dry facts. Not interesting to read at all, and so they fail to gain traction and a committed user base. The Drudge Report, on the other hand, is highly sensationalist and as a result has been in business for decades. But it is not a complete and unbiased view of the news.

scrape articles

How to determine what 20 articles to feature every day? 

Approach 1

- find a way to scrape articles by most read in the past 24 hrs

Approach 2

- scrape the headlines on a news frontpage into a list. put into one big list
    - also scrape the first 50-100 words of each article, as the headline is not enough information for chatgpt to determine what the article is about
- feed that list to chatgpt and have it group the articles into topics. each topic contains the links to all related articles.
    - Question: is chatgpt‚Äôs context window large enough for this task? might need to use an ai with a larger context window like gemini
- the 20 topics displayed on final webpage are the topics with the most articles linked to them. The idea is that topics that are written about the most extensively across news sites are the most important.

now we have a list of 20 topics, each topic paired with links to its articles 

create agree/disagree summaries

Approach

- Feed each topic and list of articles into chatgpt, prompting it to generate sections where the news sites agree/disagree

Display topics and summaries on webpage

- front page is a list of topics. when you click on one, it opens a page with the agree/disagree summary and links to the topics.
